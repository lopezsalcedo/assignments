a cryber criminal is attempting to send a link to a bank CEO by sending a link to the CEO's email talking about a new worker going in to 
work in a new bank and explains that the workers infomation was sent to him and all he needed to do was click the link but the CEO
knew that it was a phising attempt because no one from his company told him that there was going to be any new workers .
